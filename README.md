## MJO_chlorophyll_a_SST

## Research Derby project to study the connection between MJO, chlorophyll-a, and SST

Research question: What impact does the MJO have on sea surface temperature and phytoplankton biomass in the Pacific Northwest (2010 to 2020)? 

The goal of this project is to identify the impact that the Madden-Julian Oscillation has on phytoplankton biomass (using chlorophyll-a as a proxy) and sea surface temperature. Team members: Cassia Cai, Pedro Angulo-Umana, Maochuan Zhang, and Yasmine Hentati. 

Data used:
1. [Chlorophyll-a concentrations](https://nasa-develop.github.io/dnppy/modules/modis.html)
2. [MJO index](https://psl.noaa.gov/mjo/mjoindex/)
3. [ERA5 daily Precipitation](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/ECMWF_ERA5_DAILY#bands)
4. [ERA5 daily sea surface temperature](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/ECMWF_ERA5_DAILY#bands)
5. [ERA5 daily wind u- and v-components](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/ECMWF_ERA5_DAILY#bands) 

All analysis will be completed in Jupyter Notebooks. 

Tasks:
1. Load data for a specific region (160째W to 120째W, 35째N to 60째N) 
2. Correlation, lead-lag, time series analysis and other useul visualizations and/or statistics
